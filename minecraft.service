[Service]
# User and group under which the server will run.
# It's highly recommended to create a dedicated user (e.g., 'minecraft') for security.
User=minecraft
Group=minecraft

# The working directory for the server.
# This should be the directory where your start.sh script and server.jar are located.
WorkingDirectory=/opt/minecraft_server

# Path to your start script. Ensure this path is correct.
# Type=forking is often used for scripts that daemonize themselves or return control quickly.
# If your start.sh script keeps running (like the one I provided with the 'while true' loop),
# then 'Type=simple' or 'Type=exec' might be more appropriate.
# However, for a script that just launches Java and Java itself becomes the main process,
# 'Type=simple' is usually fine. Let's stick with 'simple' as the provided script
# directly runs the Java command.
Type=simple

# The command to execute to start the server.
# Make sure the path to your start.sh script is absolute.
ExecStart=/opt/minecraft_server/scripts/start.sh

# The command to execute to stop the server gracefully.
# This assumes your server has a 'stop' command.
# If your server needs a different stop command (e.g., 'say Stopping server; stop'),
# adjust this accordingly.
# For a simple script, you might just want to kill the process, but graceful shutdown is better.
# This command sends 'stop' to the screen/tmux session or directly to the server's input.
# If you are using 'nogui' and not a screen/tmux session, you might need a different approach
# to send commands to the running Java process. For simplicity, we'll assume the 'start.sh'
# manages the process directly and killing it is acceptable for 'stop'.
# A more robust stop would involve sending a 'stop' command to the server's console.
# For now, we'll use a simple kill.
ExecStop=/bin/kill -SIGINT $MAINPID

# Restart the server if it crashes.
# 'on-failure' restarts only if the service exits with a non-zero status.
# 'always' restarts regardless of exit status.
Restart=on-failure

# Delay before restarting (in seconds).
RestartSec=10

# Standard output and error will be logged to systemd journal.
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

# Give the server some time to shut down gracefully.
